# US_Housing_Macro

I am trying to gain a deeper insight into how inflation and fed rate hikes will impact the housing market.
Data is collected from the US Census Bureau https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/index.html.

## Observations
The month with the lowest annual revenue historically in the United States is December; conversely the month with the highest annual revenue is March.
The average price of homes is typically lowest in June and highest in April

The period with the sharpest increase in value was March 1986 with a 52.83% increase resulting in 9.6 Billion in revenue a 3.4 billion increase from 6.2 billion a month prior.

The period with the sharpest decline in value was May 2010 with a 34.10% decrease at 7.3 billion, a 3.7 billion dollar loss from 11 billion the previous month.

The longest annual period of expansion was 14 years ranging from 1992 to 2005 in which the United States saw revenue increase from 74.9 to 381 billion, a staggering 408% increase.

The longest annual period of recession was 6 years from 2005 to 2011 in which the annual revenue dropped 74.74%. The peak in 2005 was 381B and the valley in 2011 was 81B.
