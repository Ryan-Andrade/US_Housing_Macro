# US_Housing_Macro

I am trying to gain a deeper insight into how inflation and fed rate hikes will impact the housing market.

Questions to answer:

What is the cycle for housing market peak sales and valley sales and how long do they last?

How do these cycles connect to the key indicators of the Federal interest rates?
